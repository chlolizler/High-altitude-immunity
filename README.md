# Project Title
High-altitude adaptation: the innate immune response

# Description
Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) derived from 2 populations (lowland and highland) were subjected to a bacterial immune challenge (LPS) to elicit an innate immune response. In these mice, we collected body temperatures via PIT-tags to assess the febrile response, tracked metabolic recovery (body weight change and food consumption), analyzed blood glucose and serum corticosterone, and uncovered differential expression of genes from RNA-seq of the spleen. The effects of LPS were compared to a saline control for these parameters.
